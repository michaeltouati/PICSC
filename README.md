# PICSC
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) Simulation Cost estimator
written by Dr Michael J TOUATI 

The script needs the following Python packages :

- tkinter
- pillow (with imagetk module)

In order to use it, download or clone it and just type :

$python3 PICSC.py

A Tkinter window will show up and you can enter all needed parameters to get an estimate of the PIC simulation computational cost in terms of CPUxhours and needed RAM memory.
