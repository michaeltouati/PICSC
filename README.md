The script needs the following Python packages :

- tkinter
- PIL
- os

In order to use it, download it and just type :

$python3 PICSC_DIRECTORY/PICSC.py

A Tkinter window will show up and you can enter all the needed paramaters to get an estimate of the PIC simulation computational cost in CPUxhours as well as the needed RAM memory.
