The script needs the following Python packages :

- tkinter
- PIL

In order to use it, download or clone it and just type :

$python3 PICSC.py

A Tkinter window will show up and you can enter all the needed paramaters to get an estimate of the PIC simulation computational cost in CPUxhours as well as the needed RAM memory.
